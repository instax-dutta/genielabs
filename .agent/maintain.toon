[MAINTENANCE]
API_MANAGEMENT: Multi-key rotation is implemented via the proxy layer (api/codestral-proxy.ts). Always maintain MISTRAL_API_KEY in .env. For production expansion, use multiple keys separated by commas.
TOOL_EXTENSION: New tools should follow the structure of app/tools/bug-fixer/page.tsx. Update system prompt templates in the tool's handleSubmit.
UI_SYNC: Ensure all new components use the 'section-container' and 'premium-shadow' classes from globals.css.
ANIMATION: All text reveals must use the character-level AnimatedText component for consistency.

[ARCHITECTURAL_NOTES]
AI_READY: The codebase is model-agnostic. Prompts are isolated in page components to allow for easy fine-tuning without UI logic changes.
RELIABILITY: amount: 0.2 in AnimatedText ensures high triggering reliability on scrolled content.
VIEWPORT: Global pt-16 in ClientLayoutWrapper is tuned for the h-16 fixed header. Maintain standard padding in child sections.

[DEVELOPER_RULES]
UI: Premium Dark/Glow/Glass aesthetics only. No generic white backgrounds.
TYPOGRAPHY: Headers=Mooxy, Hero/Brand=Achiko. Regular=Next/Font/Exo_2.
INTERACTION: Hover scaling (1.02x) and subtle glow transition (300ms) required.
AI: No client-side API fetches. All requests must go through /api/codestral-proxy.
DOCS: Keep public README free of sensitive infra details; keep internal .agent/ docs verbose.
